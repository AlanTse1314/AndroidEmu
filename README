The following is the source code for various emulators on Android
as downloaded from here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/androidemu/
    
I'm assuming that being part of sourceforge, they are complying with the
SourceForge TOS.

I have not managed to get it to compile yet, and I don't even know if all of
the source code has been provided.
    
I also found out about it from here:
